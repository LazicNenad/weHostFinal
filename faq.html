                <p class="lead">If you have a quickly growing website, there will come a time when shared hosting is not enough. With that in mind, cloud hosting is here to give you the best of two worlds. The power and reliability of a VPS with the simplicity of shared
                    hosting. Get dedicated resources and let us take care of all the technical stuff!</p>

                <p class="lead"><span class='bold'>Dedicated Resources: </span>Get a dedicated IP address with a slice of RAM, CPU, and SSD Disk Space. The provided resources are fully dedicated to you and no one else!</p>

                <h1 class="md">What is the architecture of Hostinger Cloud Hosting?</h1>
                <p class="lead">At weHost, we use cloudlinux with LVE containers. Each account gets a dedicated container and is served from there. Each container has resource boundaries to make sure the host stays healthy at all times (even if, one of the accounts is
                    under a DDoS attack). In case the host needs to be put down, the account with its container can be easily migrated to a different host, to avoid unnecessary downtime. Our shared hosting accounts share hosts between several customers,
                    whereas our cloud hosting clients are served solely from the host, meaning that only their accounts are put in the whole host.</p>

                <h1 class="md">Can I upgrade from shared hosting to Cloud Hosting?</h1>
                <p class="lead">If you have a shared web hosting plan on weHost, upgrading to cloud hosting is extremely simple. All you have to do is order an upgrade from the control panel, and everything will be migrated automatically! The main difference between
                    two is that cloud hosting plan provides you with dedicated resources and the ability to manage them as you see fit. Meanwhile shared hosting typically hosts multiple servers on one dedicated machine and requires the user to share resources
                    with other servers on the machine.</p>
